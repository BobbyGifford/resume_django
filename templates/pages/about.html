                    My attitude sets me apart. I have a "go getter" mentality. I am self made and self driven. No one is
                    more driven than me.
                    When I set a goal I conquer it. Most of my peers see themselves as a (insert popular language)
                    Developer.
                    I see myself as a Developer in general. I love all coding languages and use whatever tool is
                    necessary
                    for the job.
                    I believe I enjoy coding more than most of my peers.

                <hr class="bg-white"/>
                My name is Robert but I go by Bobby. I am a software developer currently living in Cupertino across the
                street from Apple.
                <br>
                <br>
                I started using JavaScript in 2010, slightly before I went to college. I immediately fell in love with
                it. My specialty is in web development. Most of my work has been front end, although I have worked with
                full stack and continue to. My specialty is the MERN stack, Mongo Express, React, and Node. I am willing
                and open to use any language or framework. My tech stack is always growing.

                I am originally from Seattle. I moved to the Bay Area in early 2017 and have been working in software
                since. My interests involve playing guitar, football (college and NFL), and taking Udemy courses. I am
                constantly taking Udemy courses, it is by far my favorite activity.
