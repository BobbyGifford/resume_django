        <h3 class="text-center">What sets me apart</h3>
        <hr class="bg-white"/>
        My attitude sets me apart. I have a "go getter" mentality. I am self made and self driven. No one is
        more driven than me.
        When I set a goal I conquer it. Most of my peers see themselves as a (insert popular language)
        Developer.
        I see myself as a Developer in general. I love all coding languages and use whatever tool is necessary
        for the job.
        I believe I enjoy coding more than most of my peers.

        If you love your project and want someone who gives themselves fully to projects, choose me.

        <h3 class="text-center">About Me</h3>
        <hr class="bg-white"/>
        My name is Robert but I go by Bobby. I am a software developer currently living in Cupertino across the
        street from Apple.

        I started using JavaScript in 2010, slightly before I went to college. I immediately fell in love with
        it. My specialty is in web development. Most of my work has been front end, although I have worked with
        full stack and continue to. My specialty is the MERN stack, Mongo Express, React, and Node. I am willing
        and open to use any language or framework. My tech stack is always growing.

        I am originally from Seattle. I moved to the Bay Area in early 2017 and have been working in software
        since. My interests involve playing guitar, football (college and NFL), and taking Udemy courses. I am
        constantly taking Udemy courses, it is by far my favorite activity.
